"Programing languages may have many powerful features, but this power brings with it complexity, which in turn can make code more bug-prone and harder to read and maintain. The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by describing in detail the dos and don'ts of writing code. These rules exist to keep the code base manageable while still allowing coders to use language features productively."  
  
**Everyone should follow the guides without exception.**
